Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework that provides a flexible platform for building and training neural networks. It offers dynamic computational graphs and excellent GPU acceleration support.

Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that revolutionized natural language processing. They use attention mechanisms to process sequential data and have become the foundation for models like GPT, BERT, and T5.

The attention mechanism allows neural networks to focus on different parts of the input sequence when processing each element. This enables better understanding of context and relationships in the data.
